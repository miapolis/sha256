### Yet Another Rust SHA-256 Implementation
#### This one isn't well-optimized by any means, but it was a great learning experience.
- [X] It works
- [X] It isn't ridiculously slow
- [X] No external crates

This wouldn't have been possible without the detailed [animation and explanation](https://github.com/in3rsha/sha256-animation) on how this algorithm works
that I constantly referred to. Very cool stuff!
